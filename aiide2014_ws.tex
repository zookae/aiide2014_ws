\title{Experimental AI for Games Workshops}



\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Workshop Goals}

note: not a continuation.

themes / issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item foster research into new AI systems in games (e.g. Monaco and visualizing state)
\item more cross-pollination from areas of AI not used in games (e.g. novel machine vision for augmented reality; novel NLP for dialog)
\item new kinds of games and interactive entertainment from AI (e.g. drama management in L4D, neural net learning in B\&W)
\item improved game development / design via AI (e.g. PCG, design tools)
\end{itemize}

big goal: engage community in building games, ultimately lead to more playable experiences. more interested in problem/application discovery than solution



\section{Preliminary Format and Schedule}

length: 1 day

submissions: position / prototype papers for experimental applications of AI in games or novel AI-based games; no need for evaluation, instead about argumentation (e.g. thought experiment, problem formulation, prototype as initial evidence)

workshop: paper talks = participants argue for point, then breakout discussions around the key topics.
invited talks from related areas to spur discussion

encourage workshop atmosphere by focusing on presenting and discussing ideas over proving through empirical evaluation. emphasis on qualitative expectations, thought experiments, and initial prototypes.




\section{Tentative Participants}
We expect participants from AIIDE 2013's AI and Game Aesthetics and AI in the Game Design Process to be interested as the topic matter and workshop format are similar.
Those interested in the research AI game jam are also likely to be interested in this workshop due to the overlapping interests and topic matter.

Tentative attendees: Eric Butler, Jonathan Tremblay, Kristin Siu, Antonios Liapis, ...
