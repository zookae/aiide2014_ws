\section*{Abstract}



\section*{Report Body}

The Experimental AI in Games (EXAG) workshop fosters innovation in how AI is used in and for games.
Research in game AI has traditionally focused on intelligent adversarial agent behavior, exemplified by chess-playing systems such as Deep Blue.
Yet games as entertainment experiences involve far more than expert-level play.
Game design and development introduce a variety of challenges in producing content, reasoning on how gameplay creates player experiences, and dynamically manipulating game worlds in response to fit players.
In-game systems also stand to benefit from advances in AI, including novel applications of computer vision, natural language processing, user modeling, and computational creativity.
EXAG has two goals: encouraging long-term, blue sky thinking around new ways AI could be used in games and providing a venue for experiments on innovative uses of AI in games.



themes:
AI in new roles: generate games w/o knowledge; support community; as core mechanics
world information in game generation: google milking; playing games to make games
AI-player tensions: 
systems as designers: generate 3D games; critique modders; propose skins/fiction; analyze levels
